    <body style="background-color:#efc3ca; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:black;">
        <p>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
            <li>
                I see that several identical green lines are being distributed across the site.
            </li>
            <li>
                I paid much attention to the colours of the site as it is popping into my eyes, I also am very interested in the layout of the site.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
            <li>
                Saw a bunch of green lines
            </li>
            <li>
                When I interact with one of the green lines, it started playing sounds and changing words
            </li>
            <li>
                I tried clicking on different lines
            </li>
            <li>
                different lines and sounds are produced
            </li>
            <li>
                when multiple lines are played, the way the words flicker and sound combined gives off a harmonious vibe
            </li>
            <li>
                I mute the sound
            </li>
            <li>
                Then I tried to close the “cards back into the grS
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
            <li>
                I spent most of the time engaging with clicking different lines to produce a different sound, it was fun and I feel like I was playing a piano tapping on different notes and producing different sounds.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?
            <li>
                Clicking on different green lines to try to produce different sounds then also trying to find out how to close the “cards” back into lines”
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
            <li>
                I believe that the interactive experience's primary goal is to produce a simple yet engaging interactive experience, not only through words but the overall visual design of the website and combining it visual with sound experience takes it to a whole new level.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?
            <li>
                Taking the visual experience and combining it with sound, makes the experience more captivating and immersive. The combination of multiple sensory elements produces a multi-dimensional experience, I feel like it is a great way of communicating to an audience.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
            <li>
                After clicking all the green lines and experiencing the atmosphere, after a while, there is nothing left to explore. Therefore I think that after a few minutes, it should be enough for the experience. I feel like it can be explored various times as you can choose how many and which green lines to press, therefore producing a different sound each time.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?
            <li>
                I feel like it is a smart way as different green lines pressed will produce different results, however, I think it should have a CTA button appear after an adequate amount of time playing where it leads to a different theme or sound to elongate the user’s attention on the site.
            </li>

        <p>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
            <li>
                It references stop motion because the words change when the series of frames is played back and forth.
            </li>
            <li>
                It also reminds me of flash cards because of how the poems are in a “card”, and the words in it are also flickering quickly like how you do with flashcards.
            </li>
        <p>10) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?
            <li>
                The flashcard references suggest to my brain to activate  “active recall” and strengthen memory on every word that comes across my brain.    
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the animation reminds me of stop motion, I actively think that I could somehow stop the words if I click on it, because it is made of single frames played back and forth.
            </li>
        <p>11) What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?
            <li>
                The flashcard references make me feel I shall remember all the words on the “card” and it makes me a little tense but also excited.  
            </li>
            <li>
                The aesthetic of the website referenced with digital media of the early 2000s, with the simple lines and fonts, this makes me feel a reminiscence of my childhood experience with the early internet.
            </li>
        <p>12) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?
           <li>
            Words flicker too fast so I don't understand what is the poem trying to convey, I also can't figure out which words come first or last.
           </li>
           <li>
            The sound effect of the website can be frustrating to me as it doesn't sound pleasant to the ear if all the sounds are played altogether when all the cards are opened.
           </li>
           <li>
            I am a little frustrated too about being unable to close the “cards” back into how they were, I wished that would be included in the interaction to make it even more fun and complete to the UX experience.
           </li>
        <p>13) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?
            <li>
                The most satisfying element is the interaction when I click on the green lines open up, I think it is very interesting and the smoothness of the open-up animation is also very satisfying.
            </li>
            <li>
                When I click on the cards they will change colour and give me a response, it made me understand well that I was doing the correct interaction, and then the words could be paused to understand the poem clearer.
            </li>
